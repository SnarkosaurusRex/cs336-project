**A note for Prof. VanderLinden:**

Both of us worked for hours on end over the course of several days just to try to get the actual lists of playlists to work properly/show up, but were infuriatingly unsuccessful in doing so. Most recently, Lydia spent a solid 5 hours trying all kinds of things - the mess she was left with following this attempt is preserved on the branch called `lh-frustration`.

Due to the massive amount of time taken up by that, we were clearly not able to get as far with this project as we had hoped. That also meant that we were not able to complete the functionality for editing/deleting existing categories/playlists because we couldn't see or interact with the existing playlists at all within the app.

The server is fully functioning, however, with the exception of an odd issue with Mongo trying to assign duplicate `_id` values in the memberships table if a playlist was added with multiple categories.

We are obviously both very disappointed with what we ended up being able to accomplish with this project, and we hope that you will consider in your evaluation the substantial time and effort we invested into this project. Thank you!

_(Also, one additional note: In light of what happened during our class project presentations, Lydia added length constraints to the form input fields :P )_
